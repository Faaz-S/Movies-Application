# Screen Critic

- A movie review application with a React frontend, Java and Spring Boot backend, and MongoDB for database management,
  ensuring a robust and scalable full-stack solution
- Implemented a separation of concerns between the client code and the server code.
- By implementing this loosely coupled architecture, these two parts (implemented using different technologies) can evolve in parallel and independently from one another.
- Developed and tested the application to ensure proper functionality and scalability.
